This folder contains files that were annotated (with INCEpTION or Stanza) to train a model for Named Entity Recognition (NER).
This folder provides the main source of training data and should be split between training and validation sets.

## Format:
- The annotated files for NER are in the CONLL format, i.e. each token is followed by a tab, a label and a new line.
- Text units (like sentences or paragraphs) are separated from each other by two new lines.
